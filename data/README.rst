Language-Specific Data
======================

This directory contains language-specific data files. Most importantly, you will find here:

1. A list of unique characters for the target language (e.g. English) in `data/alphabet.txt`

2. A binary n-gram language model compiled by `kenlm` in `data/lm/lm.binary`

3. A trie model compiled by `generate_trie <https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech#using-the-command-line-client>`_ in `data/lm/trie`

For more information on how to build these resources from scratch, see `data/lm/README.md`
